				<p style="text-align: justify;">Burhani IT Fraternity (BITF) works on a basis of a no-profit no-loss organization, working towards defining a dream, assist them with information, guidance and resources, and motivate them to visualize and achieve that dream.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We accept donations from one and all members of the Dawoodi Bohra community, to be deposited directly into the account of BITF. A unit is defined as an amount of Rs. 300/- per month. We encourage a commitment of 1 year, payable every month.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All payments made to the organization will be legal (no cash) and the organization is committed to providing you a receipt for all payments big or small. All banking transactions are traceable and are governed as per policies of the trust of Anjuman-E-Taheri.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can also assist in getting establishments to register with us for advertisements on our organization website and Organization events. Details on charges for these will be available with the management and accounts committee. They can be reached at  educare@burhaniit.org</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We value each and every single penny donated to this worthy cause and hence put in a lot of time and effort to ensure that the funds are utilized in an absolutely non-partisan, non-influential manner. In case you would be interested in knowing how the funds are utilized, you can schedule a meeting with the finance committee to get all the answers you desire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please enroll yourself, start donating and get the satisfaction of being able to provide quality education to the people who need it the most.</p>
