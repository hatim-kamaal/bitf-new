				<p style="text-align: justify;">Pune is known as one of the major hubs for IT in India. It is only obvious that we would have a lot of mumineen working in the IT field from Pune. Conservative estimates state that we have close to 300+ mumineen working in the IT / ITES field. Ranging from small companies to working with large Fortune 500 companies, we have mumineen working for all companies of all sizes. Apart from this, we can also boast of at least 30 entrepreneurs setting up their own companies in Pune.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the 1437 Pune&nbsp;Safar Mubarak of Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin Aqa (TUS), this community came together (90 members) and collectively performed a ziyafat of Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin Aqa (TUS). This was where the foundation stone of the IT organization was planted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Post this event and a couple of months down the line, we the mumineen from the IT community of Pune are now the proud members of the Burhani IT Fraternity. BITF is (and will remain to be) an independent body functioning under the auspices of Anjuman-e-Taheri, Pune.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BITF aims to perform khidmat of Syedna&nbsp; Mufaddal&nbsp; Saifuddin Aqa (TUS) by&nbsp; assisting, guiding and mentoring mumineen brothers and sisters in Pune, in the fields of Education.</p>
