		<p style="text-align: justify;">We feel it is our duty to ensure that
			our mumineen brothers and sisters get all necessary assistance to
			turn their dreams into reality. Burhani IT Fraternity (BITF) is
			devoted towards providing assistance (motivation, financial and
			guidance) to mumineen across Pune. We strongly believe that each
			child is born with his own set of talents and we feel we can be the
			levers to unearth that talent within each child. For the elder
			generation students, we intend to provide them guidance in choosing a
			career where they can end up creating an enterprise for themselves
			and other mumineen in the future. We do not limit ourselves to
			guiding people to the field of IT. That would certainly be our forte,
			but we realize that our community has its own share of doctors,
			engineers, architects, agriculturists, exporters, lawyers, charted
			accounts. We intend to be the bridge between these students and
			professionals from the city, thereby gaining detailed insight into
			their profession.</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Hereâ€™s hoping that we inspire mumineen
			children in defining a dream, assist them with information, guidance
			and resources, and motivate them to visualize and achieve that dream.</p>
